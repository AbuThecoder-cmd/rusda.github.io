    <h1>Achievements under Cross-cutting issues/services</h1>
    <p>Cross-cutting issues of gender, environment, HIV/AIDS, ethics/integrity conflict resolution are usually <br>
        mainstreamed into our cores services. There are a few cases when they were taken up as specific training or <br>
        projects as shown below: â€¢Gender and environment analysis and mainstreaming training to individuals or <br>
        farmer groups in West Nile as well as senior staff. HIV/ADS Prevention at the Most Vulnerable Business <br>
        Enterprises Project in Rhino camp in Arua district, B2B project in sesame value chain development, and <br>
        community Empowerment programme Supported by SNV Uganda, </p>
        <h1>Motivation in offering the services</h1>
        <p>RUSDA Ltd motivation to offer the services is drawn from its mandate which is the promotion of agricultural<br>
            and environmental growth and development for the active poor, and Micro, Small and medium Enterprises <br>
            (MSMEs), including ACEs, its Vision, Mission and Strategic Objectives here above. Further RUSDAs Ltd <br>
            motivation is driven by its core values as well the services that RUSDA Ltd have been offering to the rural <br>
            communities of West Nile region right from its inception aimed at Poverty reduction and sustainable <br>
            livelihoods. The traditional oil seed crops to be promoted (simsim, soya beans, sunflower and Groundnuts) are <br>
            already crops that the farmers that RUSDA Ltd supports are involved in their production either for subsistence <br>
            or income generation hence partnering VODP2 would lead to up scaling the production and acreage of these <br>
            crops in areas of operation. RUSDA and consortium are already working with over 560 groups with average <br>
            members of 25 members/ farmers who are already involved in the cultivation of such traditional oilseeds, <br>
            horticultural crops and this partnership would effectively use experienced field officers,  the groups as entry <br>
            points for implementation in future operations with host communities aimed at  increasing the acreage of <br>
            sunflower, simsim, other crops for increased income of smallholder farmers. To date Farmers in West Nile <br>
            districts are accessing quality simsim seeds and this opportunity would effectively upscale it to farmers and any <br>
            beneficiaries to be supported </p>
